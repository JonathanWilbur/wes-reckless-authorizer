# Wildboar Email Stack Reckless Authorizer

This program responds to authorization requests from the Wildboar Email Stack
(WES). It is called "reckless" because the only thing it does is echo the
request with `authorized` set to `true`. The purpose of this is just for
testing and development. A serious authorizer should be used in production.
